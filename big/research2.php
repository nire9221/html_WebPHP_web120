<h3>how to create an html gallery</h3>
<p>To create an html gallery, we can use lightbox, which is a JavaScript library that displays images and videos by filling the screen, and dimming out the rest of the web page.</p>
<p>In order to create our html photo gallery we need 3 divs:</p>
<ul>
<li>one for the main html photo gallery</li>
<li>one for the thumbnails : the images and the Javascript code to load the full image on rollover.</li> 
<li>one for the preview : using mouseover function to run the code  (only with links, images, and buttons)  - whenever the mouse enters in that image container, the code inside the attribute will run.</li>
</ul>
