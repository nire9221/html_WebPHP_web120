<h3>how do responsive websites compare to mobile applications</h3>
<p>Responsive websites use special code (known as CSS media queries) to adapt the layout of a website to various device sizes. This allows for the same application to look differently on a mobile phone in landscape mode, a tablet in portrait, or on a desktop computer</p>
<p>Responsive mobile design generally means that your site is designed specifically for mobile use. Mobile apps are specific applications customized to each Operating System (OS) that feature unique designs and codebases. It will often be housed under a different URL and will feature subsets of your desktop content that are appropriate for mobile viewing. These pages will adapt to whatever screen size the user desires.</p>
 
<h3>responsive websites vs mobile apps</h3>
<p>with responsive design, web developers don't have to focus on specific display sizes; rather, their responsive web code is designed to adapt to a range of display sizes, presenting different layouts based on the display size and capabilities of the mobile device or PC.</p>
<p>mobile app users are trying to quickly achieve a specific goal, often in just 5-10 seconds. A curated mobile experience will include multiple resources and data feeds such as videos, maps, news, social, and specific responsive web pages from your current web site, and other 3rd party sites such as other information sources, or even payment sites. In a well-designed mobile app, only the most relevant web pages are embedded directly within the app for a seamless, fully integrated experience that keeps users focused and on task. The app then assembles and combines these feeds and web pages with new workflows and features for a truly unified and rich mobile experience.</p>
 
<h3>advantages of mobile applications over websites</h3>

<p>Mobile apps take longer to create and are more expensive, but they feature several advantages in other areas: <br></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Functionality:</b> Apps feature greater functionality than mobile-oriented sites can allow due to the way each is custom built into the device’s OS. This means that apps can easily integrate with other features and tools in a device as well as support functions that aren’t possible with web-based HTML5.</li>
<li> <b>Speed:</b> Mobile apps are designed top to bottom with efficiency in mind. Apps usually have faster loading times than web pages as they aren’t cluttered with unnecessary site elements. The user experience is optimized.</li>
<li><b>Brand Recognition:</b> Nothing beats a native app for brand awareness and marketing. With handy desktop shortcuts, mobile apps put you front and center on each user’s phone, and the custom code used to create apps can relay information back to businesses about user behaviors to inform future development decisions.</li>
</ul>
