 <p>My name is Jinyoung. </br>
I'm originally from South Korea.</br>
I've lived in Seattle for 3years </br>
I worked in logistic field until 2019,</br> 
but a lot of my friends I met in Seattle are software engineer, </br>
and I felt it's really fun and huge achievement when i did some basic coding. </br> 
since that, I started exploring the job and how to be a programmer.
