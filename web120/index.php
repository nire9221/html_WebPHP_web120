 <p>My name is Jinyoung. 
I'm originally from South Korea.
I've lived in Seattle for 3years 
I worked in logistic field until 2019, 
but a lot of my friends I met in Seattle are software engineer, and I felt it's really fun and huge achievement when i did some basic coding.  
since that, I started exploring the job and how to be a programmer.
